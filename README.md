# olberger/docker-modelio

# Introduction

[Modelio](https://www.modelio.org) 4.1.0 in a docker container (for Linux, and maybe for macOS too)

The image uses [X11](http://www.x.org) unix domain socket on the host to enable display of the Modelio desktop app. These components are available out of the box on pretty much any modern linux distribution.

OpenJDK 11 is installed, inside the container in `/usr/local/openjdk-11` (for use in Java Designer module's parameters).


# WARNINGS

* Once Launched :
    * The host shares X11 socket and IPC with the container
    => This breaks container isolation, and the contained app can listen to all X11 events !
    * **The host shares your ~/.modelio/ and ~/Documents/ModelioWorkspace/ folders (by default) with the container.**
* Use it at your own risk !

# Getting started

## Requirements

* Docker (https://www.docker.com) running
* X11 (tested with https://www.xquartz.org on macOS Catalina 10.15.7) running

## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/olberger/docker-modelio) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull olberger/docker-modelio:latest
```

Alternatively you can build the image yourself, from the contents of
the Github repo.

```bash
docker build -t olberger/docker-modelio github.com/olberger/docker-modelio
```

With the image locally available, install the wrapper script by running the following as root:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --volume /usr/local/bin:/target \
  olberger/docker-modelio:latest install
```

This will install a wrapper script named  `modelio-wrapper` to launch modelio.

## Setup on Mac (perform once)

THIS SECTION WASN'T TESTED AND SHOULD BE CHECKED. PULL REQUESTS WELCOME

1. launch XQuartz
2. in Preferences -> Security check "Authenticate connections" and "Allow connections from network clients"
3. exit and re-launch XQuartz
4. clone this repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/pascalpoizat/docker-modelio
    ```
5. enter the repository
    ```sh
    cd docker-modelio
    ```
6. build (optional)
    ```sh
    docker build --tag docker-modelio:latest .
    ```
7. enable the `run.sh` script to be run
    ```sh
    chmod +x run.sh
    ```

## Starting Modelio

Launch the `modelio-wrapper` script to enter a shell inside the Docker container

```bash
modelio-wrapper bash
```

Then the prompt should be displayed like:
```
Cleaning up stopped instances of the modelio container...
Using MODELIO_HOME: /home/olivier
Mounting '/home/olivier/Documents/ModelioWorkspace' on the host into '/home/modelio/modelio/workspace' on the guest
Limiting to 2.0 cpus for the container
Starting bash inside the container...
Inside the running container...
You can now launch Modelio by invoking 'modelio.sh' at the bash prompt, and quit with 'exit' at the end.
modelio@9749358c4a9d:~$ 
```

then type `modelio.sh` at the prompt inside the container.

## Runtime options

There are a number of options available

```
$ modelio-wrapper -h

Launch modelio using:
 modelio-wrapper [options] bash

OPTIONS:
   -c NB_CPUS                       Limit to NB_CPUS the CPU usage (default: 2.0, 0: unlimited)
   -p MODELIO_HOME                  Specify a prefix for host directories mounted inside the container (default: $HOME)
   -h                               Show this message
```

- `-c NB_CPUS`: allows controlling the number of cpus the container
  may use (docker's `--cpus` option). By default, set to
  `2.0`. Unlimited use can be specified bt passing `-c 0`.
- `-p MODELIO_HOME`: allows specifying a path under which to set the
  path of the directories used to share data between host and
  guest. By default, it will be set to $HOME, i.e. sharing directories
  `$HOME/Documents/ModelioWorkspace/` and `$HOME/.modelio/` with the
  guest. As an alternative, one may set the `MODELIO_HOME` env var.

# Running on Mac

THIS SECTION WASN'T TESTED AND SHOULD BE CHECKED. PULL REQUESTS WELCOME

Launch the `run.sh` script

```sh
./scripts/modelio-wrapper bash
```
Then launch modelio (twice if it triggers an error at first launch)

# Maintenance

## Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases:

  1. Download the updated Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker pull olberger/docker-modelio:latest
  ```

  2. Run `install` to make sure the host scripts are updated.

  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm \
    --volume /usr/local/bin:/target \
    olberger/modelio:latest install
  ```

## Uninstallation

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --volume /usr/local/bin:/target \
  olberger/docker-modelio:latest uninstall
```

## Local image rebuild

```bash
docker build --tag  olberger/docker-modelio:latest .
```

## Run without installation

For debugging purposes, one may run directly the wrapper script
without installing it in `/usr/local/bin`.
```bash
./scripts/modelio-wrapper bash
```


# Performance issues

Due to [performance issue with GTK3](https://github.com/ModelioOpenSource/Modelio/issues/11) (or another strange Java
runtime issue), the `docker run` command launched by the wrapper limits CPU usage. On a host with 8 cores (`lscpu` command), here follows the behaviour with
some values of CPU usage:

* 1.5 (core) : too slow, unusable
* 2.0 : slow (default)
* 3.0 : convenient
* 4.0 : comfortable

Adjust the `-c` option passed to the `modelio-wraper`, depending on your needs.

- Help users resolve their [issues](https://github.com/olberger/docker-modelio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).


## How it works

The wrapper scripts mounts the X11 socket in the launcher container (a Docker volume). The X11 socket allows for the user interface display on the host.

When the image is launched the following directories are mounted as volumes:

- `~/.modelio/`, or `${MODELIO_HOME}/.modelio/` if option `-p` is
  provided, or a value of `MODELIO_HOME` is defined
- `~/Documents/ModelioWorkspace/` (where `Documents` is determined
  through `XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR`), or similarly `${MODELIO_HOME}/Documents/ModelioWorkspace/`

This makes sure that the configuration of the tool are stored on the
host and files saved are preserved in the user's home on the host, if placed inside the special 'ModelioWorkspace/' subdirectory.

**Don't want to expose standard host's folders to Modelio application?**

Either set a global `MODELIO_HOME` environment variable to namespace
all modelio folders, or use the `-p` option to the wrapper script:

```sh
mkdir -p ${HOME}/modelio-guest/
export MODELIO_HOME=${HOME}/modelio-guest
```
